# api-projects-template

This is an example repository containing multiple z/OS Connect API projects. Using the `devfileV2.yaml` in this repo you can create RHOS DevSpaces for developers to build APIs with.

Each API has a directory for its contents:
- api1
- api2
- api3

Each developer should take a fork of this repo and update the devfileV2.yaml:
- Replace `<user>` with your GitHub user name.
- Replace `<apiProjectToWorkOn>` with the name of a folder within this repo which has the API you are developing

Commit these changes to a branch and push them to GitHub.
